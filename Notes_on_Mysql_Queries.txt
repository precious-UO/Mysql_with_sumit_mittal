DATABASE
    A database is a collection of data. It holds data in the form of tables. A table is a way of storing data in the form of rows and columns.
It is similar to excel spreadsheet. Apart from storing data, it also gives you the capability to access and manipulate data.
There are two types of databases: Relational Database and Non-relational Database.
In relational database data is stored in the form of rows and columns and multiple tables have some form of
relationships between them. Databases in this category are MYSQL, SQL server, PostreSQL, SQLite, MariaDB, etc.
In Non-relational database (NOSQL), the tables are different and has no form of relationship between themselves.
Databases in this category are Hbase, mongodb, cassandra, etc.

    SQL Stands for structured query language it is used to query or interact with databases. Update, interact or retrieve data in a database.
Therefore MYSQL is a relational database which holds data, and SQL is a language used to interact with the database.

CRUD OPERATIONS
    CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete. 
    Create is for creating new records using the insert statements
    Read is for seeing the contents of the table using the select statements
    Update is for updating the contents in the table using the update statement
    delete is for deleting the contents in the table using the delete statement
