DATABASE
    A database is a collection of data. It holds data in the form of tables. A table is a way of storing data in the form of rows and columns.
It is similar to excel spreadsheet. Apart from storing data, it also gives you the capability to access and manipulate data.
There are two types of databases: Relational Database and Non-relational Database.
In relational database data is stored in the form of rows and columns and multiple tables have some form of
relationships between them. Databases in this category are MYSQL, SQL server, PostreSQL, SQLite, MariaDB, etc.
In Non-relational database (NOSQL), the tables are different and has no form of relationship between themselves.
Databases in this category are Hbase, mongodb, cassandra, etc.

    SQL Stands for structured query language it is used to query or interact with databases. Update, interact or retrieve data in a database.
Therefore MYSQL is a relational database which holds data, and SQL is a language used to interact with the database.

CRUD OPERATIONS
    CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete. 
    Create is for creating new records using the insert statements
    Read is for seeing the contents of the table using the select statements
    Update is for updating the contents in the table using the update statement
    delete is for deleting the contents in the table using the delete statement

NOTE: MYSQL WON'T ALLOW YOU UPDATE OR DELETE WITHOUT THE WHERE STATEMENT. TO CORRECT THIS, CLICK ON EDIT, NEXT CLICK ON PREFERENCES, A NEW WINDOW WILL POP UP, 
CLICK ON SQL EDITOR, SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM AND UNCHECK THE CHECK BOX THAT SAYS SAFE UPDATES(REJECTS UPDATES AND DELETES WITH NO RESTRICTION) THEN CLICK OK.
FINALLY, CLICK ON RECONNECT TO SERVER.

DDL VS DML
DDL stands for data definition language and DML stands for data manipulation language.

DDL statements are the ones that change the structure of the table. They consist of SQL commands that can be used 
to define the database schema or alter it. It consists of commands such Create, Alter, Drop, etc.

DML deals with changing the data. In DML, It consists of commands such as insert, update, delete, etc.

Constraints are used to limit the type of data that goes into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data is maintained.
If there is any violation, then the action is aborted.
====================================================================================================================================================

1. SHOW DATABASES: Gives you a list of existing databases.
2. CREATE DATABASE: IF NOT EXIST database_name: Creates a new database.
3. DROP DATABASE: IF EXISTS database_name: Deletes the existing database.
4. USE database_name: Tells MYSQL that you want to use to the specified database.
5. CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXIST table_name: Creates a new table inside the database.
6. SHOW TABLES: Shows you a list of existing tables inside the specified database.
7. DESCRIBE/DESC table_name: Shows you the structure/schema of a specified table.
8. DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table_name: Deletes an existing table.
9. SELECT: Shows you the specified columns inside a table and the data they contain.
10. INSERT INTO table_name VALUES: This statement is used to insert values into a table.
11. NOT NULL: Used as a constraint to ensure that a column dosen't have empty values.
12. DEFAULT: Used to specify the default value a column should have if nothing is specified.
13. PRIMARY KEY: Used to uniquley identify data/values in a table. It ensures that a value dosen't appear twice in a record,and dosen't accept null values.
14. AUTO INCREMENT KEY: Used to automatically increase values 
15. UNIQUE KEY: Just like the primary key, it is used to uniquley identify values, but it accepts null values. 
16. WHERE: Used to filter data based on certain conditions.
17. BINARY: By default MYSQL is case insensitive, to make it case sentitive, the BINARY keyword is used. when we use the BINARY keyword, it matches the value exactly as specified.
18. AS: Used to rename column headers.
19. UPDATE: Used to modify or make corrections on already existing data in a table.
20. DELETE: Used to delete data that meet specific conditions from a table.
21. ALTER: Used to update the structure of your table.
22. TRUNCATE: Deletes data from a table by deleting the table and recreating it.
23. FOREIGN KEY: A column or set of columns in a table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY of another table. It creates a relationship between data.
